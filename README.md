## About
`create-expressapp` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built with Node.js for generating API boilerplate code. It helps developers quickly set up a robust API project with industry followed best practices, authentication, security configurations, file uploading setup with multer & cloudinary, mongoose setup and other common processes.

## Usage
To generate API boilerplate code using `expressapp`, simply run the following command:
```
$ npm init expressapp@latest
```

This command will initialize the `expressapp` CLI and prompt you to select the type of boilerplate you want to generate. Currently, `expressapp` supports two types:
1. **Full setup API:** Includes authentication, security configurations, and common processes.
2. **Web app with template engine (ejs):** Includes basic setup.
